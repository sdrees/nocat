# nocat
No cat is a client communicating via text protocol to endpoints of certain kinds.

## Synopsis
Simple single file client python script that requires a somehow recent `python` install.

You can configure facts about the protocol used like e.g. the special commands inside `JSON` configuration files that are read upon start.

A sample configuration is provided that should get you started easily.

In case a working `readline` module is detected upon start, the usual UNIX command line comfort like navigation, incremental search and history are not blocked ;-).

If such an install is not present, a minimal history functionality is offered but otherwise no interactive fun aspect ...


Enjoy!

Note: The default branch is `default` :wink:
